The Simple Simon Game Website was created as a fun project to bring the nostalgia of the classic Simon Says game to the digital world. This website was developed using basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery commands.

- How to Play:

1) Press any key on your keyboard to start.
2) Watch and listen as Simon plays a sequence of tones and lights.
3) Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order.
